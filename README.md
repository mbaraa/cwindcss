## Units

CSS has a wide variety of units for expressing different types of values. Here's a breakdown of some common categories and their units:

- Absolute Units: These units have a fixed size, regardless of the context.

* [x] px: Pixels. This is the most common unit for screen displays.
* [x] in: Inches.
* [x] cm: Centimeters.
* [x] mm: Millimeters.
* [x] pt: Points (1pt = 1/72 of an inch).
* [x] pc: Picas (1pc = 12pt).

- Relative Units: These units are relative to another value, such as the font size or viewport dimensions.

* [x] em: Relative to the font size of the element.
* [x] rem: Relative to the font size of the root element (usually the <html> element).
* [x] %: Percentage.
* [x] ex: Relative to the x-height of the element's font.
* [x] ch: Relative to the width of the "0" character in the element's font.
* [x] vw: Viewport width (1vw = 1% of the viewport width).
* [x] vh: Viewport height (1vh = 1% of the viewport height).
* [x] vmin: Viewport minimum (1vmin = 1% of the viewport's smaller dimension).
* [x] vmax: Viewport maximum (1vmax = 1% of the viewport's larger dimension).

- Angle Units:

* [x] deg: Degrees.
* [x] rad: Radians.
* [x] grad: Gradians.
* [x] turn: Turns (1turn = 360deg).

- Time Units:

* [x] s: Seconds.
* [x] ms: Milliseconds.

- Resolution Units:

* [x] dpi: Dots per inch.
